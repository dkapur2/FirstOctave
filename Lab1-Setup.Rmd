## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

*What happens when you surround text with one-star pairs?*

**Text becomes italicized**

**What happens when you surround text with two-star pairs?**

**Text becomes bold**

***What happens when you surround text with three-star pairs?***

**Text becoms bold and italicized**

1.  Start typing this list. Note there are two spaces between the period 
    and the word "Start".
2.  Type the second line of the list
1.  What happens if I type step 3 as another step 1?

**The number 1 at the beginning becomes 3**

*   What does this star at the beginning do?
*   Visually, it's similar to the numbered list.

**The star creates a bullet point list**

1.  What happens if we nest a list? **We can create lists within lists**
    1.  Type four spaces, then type the number
    2.  Did this do what you expected? **Yes, made a indented nested list**
2.  What if we contine the numbers this way?
    *   What happens if we indent using stars **Starts using bullet points**
    *   Let's add another one for good measure.
        *   Can we get another level of nesting?  **Yes, now it is dashes**

**qplot & print(mgp) did not run in rstudio but I used rOnline and it worked, I spoke to the lab instructor about this**

**qplot created a scatterplot graph with points**
**the print statement created a table with the same information**
